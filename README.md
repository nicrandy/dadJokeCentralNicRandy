# Welcome to Dad Joke Central!

A community collection of wholesome, groan-inducing quips. Share your favorite knee-slappers and give a +1 vote to every gag that busted you up!

# Objectives

- Our team sought to create an app that would allow dads to find community amongst like-minded practical jokesters. Dad Joke Central will serve as a cornerstone of the dad community by collecting user-created dad jokes, allowing members to determine which jokes showed the most paternalistic sense of humor, and allowing users to manage personal user profiles.

# Who is this for? 

- With our simple user interface, we invite any user to share some goofs and gaffs.

---

# Packages/Dependencies used 

- bcrypt, connect-mongo, dotenv, ejs, express, express-flash, express-session, mongodb, mongoose, morgan, nodemon, passport, passport-local, validator

---

# Install all the dependencies or node packages used for development via Terminal

`npm install`

# Optimization

- Given more resources to invest in this project, our team would have like to: 
  - Improve the voting system, with the option to remove likes and add dislikes to a post
  - Add a sort function where users can order posts by parameters such as total likes and date posted
